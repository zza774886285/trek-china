/**
 * Twelve-hour clock handling for imported booking documents (#2094).
 *
 * A confirmation mail prints "01:11 pm". Every downstream consumer in TREK
 * expects a naive 24-hour local string, and the mapper used to reach it by
 * slicing: `'2026-06-11T02:30 PM'.slice(11, 16)` yields '02:30'. The hour
 * survives, the half of the day does not, and the booking silently lands
 * twelve hours early. Because the arrival then sorts before the departure, the
 * router also rolls it onto the next day, so a three-hour domestic flight is
 * rendered as an overnight.
 *
 * The client has carried the same fix since #1725 (client/src/utils/formatters.ts);
 * this is the server half, which was never pulled across. The regex here is
 * deliberately looser than the client's: the server also sees 'HH:MM:SS AM' and
 * 'a.m.' straight out of a PDF.
 *
 * Everything here is total: a value that cannot be read comes back unchanged
 * rather than becoming null, so no format that works today can start failing.
