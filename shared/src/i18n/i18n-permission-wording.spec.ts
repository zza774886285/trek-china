/**
 * The permission list has to describe what the install actually does.
 *
 * `geolocation:read` promised that the browser would ask before a plugin saw a
 * position. It does not: the host reads the position on TREK's own origin, so
 * whatever the reader already granted this site covers the plugin too, and the
 * prompt they were told to wait for never comes. A consent screen that oversells
 * the guard standing behind it is worse than one that says nothing.
 *
 * Scoped to `en/`, like the self-host guard next door: it is the source every
 * translation is made from, and a translation still carrying the older phrasing
 * is a translation lagging behind rather than a broken build.
