/**
 * The TREK Studio book document — what a photo book *is*, independent of how it

 *
 * Two decisions carry the rest of the format:
 *
 * 1. **Everything geometric is in millimetres.** Not pixels: a pixel means
 *    nothing to a print shop, and it changes meaning with the device pixel
 *    ratio and the browser zoom. CSS maps 1in onto 96px, 25.4mm and 72pt with a
 *    fixed ratio, so the editor can render the document at `transform: scale()`
 *    and the print renderer at 1:1 and land on the same page. Values are stored
 *    rounded to two decimals — 10µm, far below any imagesetter — so a JSON round
 *    trip cannot accumulate drift.
 *
 * 2. **The paint order is the array order.** `elements[0]` is at the back. No
 *    `zIndex` field that could disagree with itself, "bring to front" is a
 *    splice, and because the DOM paints in the same order the editor and the
 *    renderer agree for free.
 *
 * A text element may be *bound* to a piece of the journey (an entry's title, its
 * story, a photo caption). A bound element re-reads its source when the book is
 * opened, so fixing a typo in the journal fixes it in the book — until someone
 * edits the text in Studio, which sets `overridden` and stops the sync.

 * ── The travel elements ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A photo book of a journey is not a photo album: the trip carries facts —

 * better than a generic book maker, and it is the one thing TREK is in a

 * journey.
 *
 * **Every one of them carries its own values.** The numbers are resolved when
 * the element is placed and stored in the document, and the renderer reads them
 * from there — it never fetches. Three reasons, and the third is the one that
 * decides it:
 *
 * 1. The print renderer is headless Chromium loading a document. A page that
 *    needs a logged-in API call to know what it says is a page that prints
 *    blank on the day the token expires.
 * 2. A book is a record of a trip as it was. Adding a stop next year should not
 *    silently rewrite the distance printed in last year's book.
 * 3. It makes the elements ordinary. They move, resize, lock, undo and park like
 *    everything else, because they *are* like everything else.
 *
 * `stale` is how the editor offers the other behaviour without giving up any of
 * that: it marks a snapshot that no longer matches the journey, and the
 * inspector shows a refresh button. Updating is a choice, not a surprise.

 * every book with one on a page refused to save, and would have opened blank.
 * Both the client's load seam and the server's read *and* write path run
 * through here, which means the empty book was also what got written down.
 *
 * So a document that fails whole is tried again with the unreadable elements
 * removed, and only a document that fails even then is given up on. Losing one
 * decoration to a version skew is a shrug; losing the book is not.
