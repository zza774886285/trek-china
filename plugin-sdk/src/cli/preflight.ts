/**
 * trek-plugin preflight — run the registry's CI checks locally, BEFORE you open a PR.
 *
 * This used to be the ONLY place the registry's real rules were applied, which made it the place
 * authors discovered their README was unwritten — over the network, against a pushed tag, after
 * an immutable GitHub release had been cut. The rules now live in ./checks/ and most of them fire
 * offline from `status` and `validate`, long before any of that. What preflight adds is the last
 * mile: the things that can only be known once the tag, the release and the registry exist.
 *
 * The contract has not changed, and now covers the whole check registry:
 * A GATE THE REGISTRY HAS AND WE DON'T IS A FALSE GREEN, and an author trusts a green.
 * test/checks-parity.test.ts is what keeps this honest.
