/**
 * The check registry: every gate the TREK-Plugins registry enforces, declared ONCE.
 *
 * The problem this solves: the registry's gates are, almost all of them, functions of two
 * files that are sitting in the author's working directory (`trek-plugin.json`, `README.md`).
 * But CI reads them over the network at a pinned commit, so we used to only check them over
 * the network too — from `preflight`, which runs against a PUSHED TAG. By then the author has
 * cut an immutable GitHub release, and the registry pins its sha256. Learning there that the
 * README is 61 chars short is learning it one step too late.
 *
 * So each check declares what it NEEDS rather than where it runs:
 *
 *   depth: 'offline'  — a pure function of the working tree. Runs in `status`, `validate`,
 *                       `preflight` and as `publish`'s first step. This is most of them.
 *   depth: 'network'  — genuinely needs GitHub or the registry repo (a tag must resolve to a
 *                       commit; an artifact must download and hash). Only four are really
 *                       like this. They run in `preflight` and `publish`.
 *
 * One list, three depths. The contract inherited from preflight.ts still holds and now covers
 * `validate` too: A GATE THE REGISTRY HAS AND THIS FILE DOESN'T IS A FALSE GREEN, and an
 * author trusts a green. When TREK-Plugins' scripts/validate-entry.mjs or check-readme.mjs
 * grows a rule, it grows one here — test/checks-parity.test.ts is what stops the two drifting.

 * The journey, in the order an author walks it. `status` prints its checklist grouped by

 * time would be exactly the over-eager gatekeeping this rework exists to remove.
