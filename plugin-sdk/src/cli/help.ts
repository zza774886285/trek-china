/**
 * Help, tiered.
 *
 * The old help was eleven commands in one flat list, one line each, with no order and no
 * per-command detail — `trek-plugin dev --help` fell through to the same flat list. So the only
 * description of any command was that one line, and nothing anywhere said which to run first.
 *
 * Two changes. The top-level lists THE PATH (create → dev → status → publish) and pushes the
 * other seven to an "Also" line: they are real commands, and an author who knows what `entry`
 * is can still reach for it, but nobody has to learn eleven things to publish a plugin. And
 * every command now has its own page, with what it does, when you would reach for it, and its
 * flags.

  1. check       every registry gate that can be checked locally
  2. pack        build plugin.zip
  3. release     git tag, push, and cut the GitHub release with the artifact
  4. preflight   the gates that need the tag and the release to exist
  5. submit      open the PR against the TREK-Plugins registry

Step 1 comes first for a reason: a GitHub release is effectively immutable, because the registry
pins its sha256. If a check fails, NOTHING is packed, tagged, pushed or released — so you can fix
it and re-run against the same version.

And when a LATER step fails, publish rolls back exactly what the run created — the release, the
pushed tag, the local tag — so the same tag is free to re-run against once you have fixed the
problem. Pass --keep-release to leave them in place instead (the error then prints the manual
cleanup). Anything that existed before the run is never touched. A leftover tag from an earlier
failed run is recognised (no release for it, not on HEAD) and moved to HEAD rather than reused.

In a terminal it OFFERS TO SIGN, and creates a key for you if you have none. A signature proves the
artifact came from you, not just that its bytes match what the registry saw. You can add signing
later — publishing unsigned now and signing at v1.4.0 breaks nobody — but you can never take it
back: once a plugin has shipped signed, TREK refuses an unsigned update to it. So back the key up.
Scripts are never prompted; pass --sign.

Needs git and an authenticated \`gh\`.

  --sign [key]      sign the artifact (default key: ~/.trek-plugin/signing.key)
  --allow-key-change  rotate to a NEW signing key as part of this release: the older versions
                    are re-signed with it, and the registry PR is flagged as a rotation (a
                    maintainer must apply the allow-key-change label; every admin must
                    re-trust the plugin). Without this flag, a key that differs from the
                    published one is refused before anything is tagged. See \`rotate-key\`
                    to rotate without shipping a version.

the registry PR flagged as a rotation. To rotate WHILE shipping a version instead, use
\`publish --sign --allow-key-change\`.
