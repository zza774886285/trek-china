/**
 * Signing, proposed rather than buried.
 *
 * `keygen` lived under "Advanced…" in the menu and `--sign` was a flag you had to already know
 * about, so the default path — the one almost everyone takes — shipped unsigned, and nothing
 * anywhere mentioned that signing existed. That is the wrong default to arrive at by accident,
 * because of what signing actually means (server registry.service.ts, verifySignatureAndTofu):
 *
 *   - Unsigned throughout is fine. The sha256 pin is the only guarantee, and TREK accepts it.
 *   - UNSIGNED → SIGNED later is allowed. Nothing is pinned until a signed version installs, so
 *     adding a key at v1.4.0 breaks nobody. Signing late is a real option, not a lost cause.
 *   - SIGNED → UNSIGNED is refused forever (SIGNATURE_MISSING) on every instance that already has
 *     the plugin. And rotating the key needs a registry maintainer override AND an admin re-trust
 *     on every instance.
 *
 * So it is a one-way door you may walk through late, but never back out of. That makes the right
 * prompt an honest recommendation with the consequence attached — not a scare, and not silence.
 *
 * The other half of this file is the guard. If a plugin was published signed and you publish
 * unsigned, the registry refuses it — and `preflight` caught that at step 4, AFTER the immutable
 * GitHub release was cut. Same trap as the one `publish`'s reorder closed. It belongs in step 1.
