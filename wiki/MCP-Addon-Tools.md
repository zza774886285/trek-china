# MCP Addon Tools and Resources

This page covers MCP tools and resources that require specific addons to be enabled on your TREK instance. For the rest of the surface (trips, places, day planning, accommodations, transport, reservations, tags, maps, and notifications — plus the Budget tools, which need the Budget addon but are documented there) see [MCP-Tools-and-Resources](MCP-Tools-and-Resources).

## Addon-gated tools

### Packing _(Packing addon required)_

| `apply_packing_template` | Apply a saved packing template to a trip. |
| `save_packing_template` | Save the current packing list as a reusable template. Templates are global, so this is admin only — a non-admin gets `Admin access required`. |

### Collab _(Collab addon required)_

Requires `collab:read` or `collab:write` scope.

The addon alone is not enough. Collab has four sub-features an admin switches on and off independently in Admin → Addons — Notes, Polls, Chat and What's Next, all on by default — and three of them gate MCP entries. A tool or resource is only registered when its own sub-feature is enabled on top of the addon, so switching one off makes its entries vanish from the tool list rather than return an error. What's Next has no MCP tools or resources of its own, so toggling it changes nothing here.

| Sub-feature | Tools it gates | Resource it gates |
|---|---|---|
| Notes | `create_collab_note`, `update_collab_note`, `delete_collab_note` | `trek://trips/{tripId}/collab-notes` |
| Polls | `list_collab_polls`, `create_collab_poll`, `vote_collab_poll`, `close_collab_poll`, `delete_collab_poll` | `trek://trips/{tripId}/collab/polls` |
| Chat | `list_collab_messages`, `send_collab_message`, `delete_collab_message`, `react_collab_message` | `trek://trips/{tripId}/collab/messages` |
