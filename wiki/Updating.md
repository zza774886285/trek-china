# Updating

How to update TREK to a newer version without losing data.

## Before You Update

Back up your data first. Go to Admin Panel → Backups and create a manual backup, or copy your `./data` and `./uploads` directories to a safe location. See [Backups](Backups) for details.

## Image Tags

| Tag | Example | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `latest` | `mauriceboe/trek:latest` | Always the newest release across all major versions |
| Major version | `mauriceboe/trek:4` | Latest release pinned to that major version |
| Full version | `mauriceboe/trek:4.0.0` | Exact release; never changes |

Use `latest` or a major-version tag if you want updates on each redeploy. Use a full version tag for explicit control — update by changing the tag, not by re-pulling.

## Docker Compose (Recommended)

**`latest` or major-version tag:**

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

This pulls the newest matching image and recreates the container with your existing volumes. Your data is untouched.

**Pinned full-version tag:**

Edit `docker-compose.yml`, update the tag in the `image:` line (e.g. `4.0.0` → `4.0.1`), then redeploy:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Docker Run

If you started TREK with `docker run`, pull the new image and replace the container:

```bash
docker pull mauriceboe/trek
docker rm -f trek
docker run -d --name trek -p 3000:3000 \
  -v ./data:/app/data \
  -v ./uploads:/app/uploads \
  -e ENCRYPTION_KEY=<your-key> \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  mauriceboe/trek
```

> **Tip:** Not sure which volume paths you used? Check before removing:
> ```bash
> docker inspect trek --format '{{json .Mounts}}'
> ```

## Helm (Kubernetes)

> **⚠️ Chart repository moved:** The Helm chart is no longer served at `https://mauriceboe.github.io/TREK` (the project moved from a personal repo to the `liketrek` organization). The canonical chart URL is now `https://chart.liketrek.com` — a custom domain (CNAME) for the GitHub Pages site at `https://liketrek.github.io/TREK`, so it stays stable even if the repository moves again. If your `trek` repo still points to an old URL, switch it before updating:
>
> ```bash
> helm repo remove trek
> helm repo add trek https://chart.liketrek.com
> ```
>
> You can check which URL you have configured with `helm repo list`. Existing releases are unaffected — only the repo URL changes.

To update to the newest chart release:

```bash
helm repo update
helm upgrade trek trek/trek
```

Your existing values and PVCs (data, uploads) are preserved. To pin an exact chart version instead, pass `--version <x.y.z>`.

See [Install-Helm](Install-Helm) for the full installation walkthrough and values reference.

## Database Migrations

TREK runs any pending database migrations automatically at startup. No manual migration steps are required after pulling a new image.

## Encryption Key Note

If you are upgrading from a version that predates the dedicated `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (i.e. you have no `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable set), TREK automatically falls back to `./data/.jwt_secret` on startup and immediately promotes it to `./data/.encryption_key`. No manual steps are required — the transition is handled at first boot after the upgrade.

If you want to rotate to a new key at any point (not required for a normal update), see [Encryption-Key-Rotation](Encryption-Key-Rotation) for the full procedure.

## Proxmox VE (LXC)

If you installed TREK via the [Proxmox VE Community Scripts](https://community-scripts.org/scripts/trek), run the following command inside the **LXC container** and select **Update** when prompted:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/main/ct/trek.sh)"
```

> **Tip:** Always check the [community-scripts TREK page](https://community-scripts.org/scripts/trek) to confirm the latest command before running.

The script stops the service, backs up your data and uploads, applies the new release, restores the backup, and restarts. No manual steps required.

To verify the update completed and check for errors:

```bash
# Inside the container (pct enter <id> from the Proxmox shell)
journalctl -u trek -n 50
```

## Portainer

Open the **Stacks** list, click the TREK stack, then click **Redeploy**.

**`latest` or major-version tag** — enable the **Re-pull image and redeploy** switch before confirming. Portainer pulls the newest matching image and recreates the container.

![Re-pull image and redeploy switch ticked, with arrows pointing to the switch and the Update button](assets/portainer-force-pull.png)

**Pinned full-version tag** (e.g. `4.0.0`) — edit the stack, update the tag in the `image:` line, then click **Update the stack**. No re-pull switch needed; the tag change forces a fresh pull.

See [Install-Portainer](Install-Portainer) for the full installation walkthrough.

## Unraid

In the Unraid Docker tab, click the TREK container and select **Update**. Unraid will pull the latest image and restart with the same volumes.

## Next Steps

- [Backups](Backups) — schedule automatic backups so you always have a restore point before updates
- [Encryption-Key-Rotation](Encryption-Key-Rotation) — if you need to rotate or migrate the encryption key
- [Install-Docker-Compose](Install-Docker-Compose) — switch to Compose for easier future updates
