# MCP Overview

TREK includes a built-in [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) server. MCP is an open standard that lets AI assistants read and modify data in external services through a structured API. When the MCP addon is enabled on your TREK instance, AI clients such as Claude.ai, Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, and others can connect directly to your trips.

## What you can do

Once connected, an AI assistant can work with your TREK data in a single conversation:

- Create and update trips, days, and itineraries
- Search for real-world places and add them to your trip
- Build and manage packing lists and to-do items
- Track budgets and expenses across trip members
- Create reservations, transport bookings, and accommodations
- Send collab messages and notes to other trip members
- Mark countries and regions as visited in Atlas
- Log vacation days in Vacay
- Write journey entries across multiple trips

Changes made through MCP are broadcast to all connected clients in real-time — exactly like changes made in the web UI.

## Authentication options

| Use case | Method |
|---|---|
| Interactive client (Claude.ai, Cursor, VS Code…) | OAuth 2.1 with browser consent — TREK issues tokens after you approve scopes in a consent screen |
| AI agent or script running unattended | Machine client (client_credentials) — token obtained directly via `client_id` + `client_secret`, no browser ever opened |
| Legacy setups | Static API token — deprecated, full access, no scopes |

See [MCP-Setup](MCP-Setup) for step-by-step instructions for each method.

## Requirements

- **MCP addon enabled** — an administrator must enable the MCP addon (`mcp`) from the Admin Panel before the `/mcp` endpoint becomes available and the MCP section appears in user settings.
- **`APP_URL` set** — set the `APP_URL` environment variable to your TREK instance's public URL so OAuth discovery advertises the right issuer and endpoints. If it is unset or not a valid URL, TREK falls back to the first entry of `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, and then to `http://localhost:{PORT}`. Only an `https://` origin or `localhost` / `127.0.0.1` is accepted as the issuer — anything else is replaced by `http://localhost:{PORT}`, which remote OAuth clients cannot reach.

## Rate limits and session limits

| Setting | Default | Environment variable |
|---|---|---|
| Requests per minute per user | 300 | `MCP_RATE_LIMIT` |
| Max concurrent sessions per user | 20 | `MCP_MAX_SESSION_PER_USER` |
| Session idle timeout (seconds) | 3600 | `MCP_SESSION_TTL` |
| SSE keep-alive interval (seconds, 0 = off) | 25 | `MCP_SSE_KEEPALIVE` |

Rate limits are tracked per user–client pair, so each OAuth client has its own independent window. Sessions expire after 1 hour of inactivity by default (`MCP_SESSION_TTL`); an open SSE stream counts as activity. The server also sends an SSE comment ping every 25 seconds so reverse proxies with idle timeouts (e.g. nginx's default 60s) don't kill the stream between tool calls.

Reaching `MCP_MAX_SESSION_PER_USER` does not refuse the request: the server closes that user's least-recently-active session to make room for the new one. This keeps a client that cannot hold onto its session id from locking itself out of the server.

> **Reverse proxy:** MCP sessions depend on the `Mcp-Session-Id` header travelling in both directions. A proxy that strips it makes every tool call open a new session instead of reusing one. Nginx and Caddy pass it through by default — see [Reverse-Proxy](Reverse-Proxy) if you have customised header handling.

> **Kubernetes / multi-replica:** MCP sessions are held in memory per instance. With more than one replica you need sticky sessions (or a single replica), or clients will intermittently see `404 Session not found`.

## Endpoint

```
https://<your-trek-instance>/mcp
```

If the MCP addon is not enabled, this endpoint returns `403`. If authentication fails, it returns `401`.

> **Admin:** Enable the MCP addon in [Admin-Addons](Admin-Addons). Set `APP_URL` for OAuth discovery. Revoke tokens and manage OAuth clients from [Admin-MCP-Tokens](Admin-MCP-Tokens). Adjust rate and session limits with `MCP_RATE_LIMIT` and `MCP_MAX_SESSION_PER_USER` — see [Environment-Variables](Environment-Variables).
