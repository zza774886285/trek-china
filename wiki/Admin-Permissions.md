# Admin — Permissions

The Permissions panel, located at the bottom of the **Users** tab, controls which role level is required to perform each action. Changes apply immediately across the entire instance.

## Role model

TREK uses four permission levels, ordered from most to least privileged:

| Level | Who it includes |
|-------|----------------|
| `admin` | Instance administrators only |
| `trip_owner` | The user who created the trip |
| `trip_member` | Any user who is a member of the trip |
| `everybody` | Any authenticated user (for `trip_create`: no trip context required; for all other actions: any authenticated user with trip access) |

Each action is assigned a minimum required level. A user whose role is at or above that level can perform the action. Not every level is available for every action — each action exposes only the levels that make sense for it. For example, `trip_create` only allows `everybody` or `admin`, while `trip_edit` only allows `trip_owner` or `trip_member`.

## Action categories

Actions are grouped into five categories:

### Trip

| Action key | What it controls |

| `trip_create` | Create a new trip |
| `trip_edit` | Edit trip name, dates, description, and currency |
| `trip_delete` | Permanently delete a trip |
| `trip_archive` | Archive or unarchive a trip |
| `trip_cover_upload` | Upload or change the cover image for a trip |

| `member_manage` | Invite or remove trip members |

| `file_delete` | Move files to trash or permanently delete them |

### Content & Schedule

## Changing permissions

Each action row has a dropdown. Select the minimum role level required. A **customized** badge appears next to any action that has been changed from its default.

Click **Save** (top-right of the panel) to persist your changes. Use the **Reset to defaults** button (circular arrow icon) to revert all actions to their shipped defaults without saving — you still need to click **Save** after resetting if you want to persist the reset state.
