 * `users` columns alone, which meant "the key of the admin with the lowest id"
 * for everyone else and produced #1939: the admin searched with the key they
 * had just saved, every other member searched with a stranger's and got a 403
 * from Google.
 *
 * Stored as an encrypted `app_settings` row under the name below, reusing
 * apiKeyCrypto, so the format matches what the users columns already hold and
 * a legacy plaintext value still reads back.
