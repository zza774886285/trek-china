/**
 * Injectable facade over the websocket module singleton (roadmap Phase 0 item 3).
 *
 * Migrated Nest services inject this instead of importing `broadcast`/
 * `broadcastToUser` module globals. The actual transport (rooms, auth,
 * heartbeat, rate limiting) stays in src/websocket.ts — a future
 * @WebSocketGateway swap happens behind this facade, invisibly.
 *
 * Both methods delegate to the live module exports *at call time* (same
 * pattern as DatabaseService.canAccessTrip): tests vi.mock src/websocket
 * per file, and the stubs must keep flowing through here. Never capture
 * the functions at construction, and never dereference an export the
 * method wasn't asked for — many test mocks provide `broadcast` only.
 *
 * The service is deliberately dependency-free so out-of-container code (the
 * auth.bridge graph, the no-Nest test harnesses) can construct it with a bare
 * `new RealtimeService()`.

  /**
   * Broadcast an event to all sockets in a trip room. Mirrors the
   * websocket.ts signature exactly: `excludeSid` is the X-Socket-Id
   * echo-suppression contract (the originating client is skipped);
   * `onlyUserId` narrows delivery to one user's sockets (#858 private
   * packing items).
   *
   * Compile-time contract (runtime is a pure pass-through): the event name
   * must be a key of the shared TREK_WS_EVENTS registry and the payload must
   * match its schema — a typo'd name or drifted payload fails `tsc`, never
   * ships silence. The `plugin:` overload is the deliberate escape hatch for
   * the host's force-namespaced `plugin:<id>:<event>` broadcasts.
   *
   * Rest-spread keeps the caller's exact argument arity — dozens of test
   * mocks assert the precise call shape (3, 4 or 5 args), so the facade
   * must not pad omitted optionals with explicit `undefined`s.
