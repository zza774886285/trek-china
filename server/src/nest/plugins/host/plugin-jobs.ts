/**
 * Host-side scheduler for a plugin's declared background jobs (#plugins).
 *
 * A plugin declares `jobs` (id + cron `schedule`) in its code; the child reports
 * them at load. This wires each to a `cron` CronJob in the HOST and fires
 * `invoke(id, 'invoke.job', { jobId })` on the tick. Kept deliberately small and
 * pure so it is unit-testable in isolation of the supervisor.
 *
 * Safety: (1) OPT-IN — a job is scheduled only if the admin granted `jobs:run`,
 * because scheduled work runs with NO acting user and is a distinct risk class
 * from a user-triggered route. (2) A job carries no user, so every trip read it
 * attempts is refused by the RPC host — a job can only touch its own db / declared
 * egress. (3) An invalid cron is skipped (never runs). (4) The tick callback and
 * `stop()` are wrapped so a throwing job or a stray task can never break the host
 * or leak across a deactivation.
 *
 * The library is `cron` (the one @nestjs/schedule wraps), migrated from
 * node-cron when the core scheduler retired; tests/unit/plugins/
 * plugin-jobs.cron-compat.test.ts pins that the accepted grammar did not narrow.
