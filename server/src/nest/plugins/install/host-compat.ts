 * The running version as a plain release triple, or null when it can't be parsed at all.
 *
 * Prereleases are deliberately COERCED to their target release: 3.4.0-rc.1 compares as
 * 3.4.0, and 4.0.0-rc.1 as 4.0.0. Both halves of that matter, and semver's own ordering
 * gets both wrong for this purpose:
 *
 *  - Plain `satisfies()` excludes a prerelease from any range that doesn't name one, so
 *    3.4.0-rc.1 would fail ">=3.2.0 <4.0.0" and EVERY plugin on the instance would go
 *    incompatible the moment TREK shipped a release candidate.
 *  - `includePrerelease` fixes that but orders 4.0.0-rc.1 BEFORE 4.0.0, so it satisfies
 *    "<4.0.0" — letting a plugin that disclaims TREK 4 load on a build that already
 *    carries TREK 4's breaking changes. That is the precise failure this gate exists to
 *    prevent.
 *
 * Coercing to the release says the useful thing instead: for compatibility purposes, an
 * rc of 4.0 IS 4.0.
 *
 * A null host NEVER blocks anything (see {@link hostSatisfies}). This is deliberate:
 * APP_VERSION is a Docker build ARG that defaults to the literal string `dev`, and an
 * unversioned build must stay fully usable. The warning exists so that a MISCONFIGURED
 * APP_VERSION in production — which silently switches this whole gate off — is visible
 * in the logs instead of being discovered when an incompatible plugin misbehaves.
