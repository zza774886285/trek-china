   * Two ways in, and a place usually has only one of them: mappers tag either
   * `wikipedia` or `wikidata`, rarely both. The Wikidata route goes through
   * sitelinks, which is also what makes the language choice honest — asking
   * `<userlang>.wikipedia.org` for a title taken from the German tag returns
   * nothing, so without sitelinks a German article is all a Korean reader could
   * ever get.
   *
   * Wikivoyage before Wikipedia at every step: it describes a place for someone
   * about to go there, where Wikipedia opens with area in square kilometres.
