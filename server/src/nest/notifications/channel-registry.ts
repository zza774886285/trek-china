 * gets a second, empty registry - plugin channels would then go quiet with no
 * error anywhere. The built-ins are registered from NotificationsService's
 * constructor, so every path that can dispatch has them. (The last production
 * out-of-container consumer, notifications.instance.ts, died with the bridge
 * fold - a provider registry is thinkable now, but the harnesses still hang
