//
// A channel is anything that delivers a *rendered* notification out of TREK:
// email, webhook, ntfy, and any plugin that implements the `notificationChannel`
// hook. In-app is deliberately NOT a channel — it writes typed rows with
// scope/target/callback payloads rather than a title+body, so it keeps its own
// path in NotificationsService.send(). The split mirrors the one shared/ already
// draws in i18n/<locale>/externalNotifications.ts.
//
// Channels are declarative: they say what they support and whether a given user
// has credentials, and they send. They do NOT consult preferences — the admin
// toggle (`notification_channels`) and the per-user event opt-outs are applied by
// the dispatch loop.
