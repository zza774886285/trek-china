/**
 * The single-reservation hydration reads, split out of ReservationsService (the
 * trek_photos repository precedent) so consumers outside ReservationsModule can
 * reach them without importing the module. The concrete case: the AirTrail
 * write-back (AirtrailLinkService) needs the hydrated row for its payload and
 * its update broadcast, and injecting ReservationsService there would close
 * ReservationsModule → AirtrailCoreModule → ReservationsModule — the cycle
 * that used to force airtrail.bridge. ReservationsService injects this and
 * delegates, so there is exactly one copy of each query.
