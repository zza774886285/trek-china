 * WebAuthn pair share a handler with keys the admin does own, and the llm_*
 * family is writable through per-user settings, the instance defaults and the
 * addon config alike — so a route-level refusal would be both too coarse and
 * incomplete.

 * the one that reaches the browser: a managed instance ships with the operator's
 * public pk.* token, injected when the settings are read, and a per-user value
 * saved over it would only break the map for that user.
 *
 * carto_api_key is the same shape, injected on read and public in the browser,
 * and it is the operator's for one more reason: the key is registered to
 * whoever runs the instance, and CARTO's terms hold that account answerable for
 * the tiles it fetches.
