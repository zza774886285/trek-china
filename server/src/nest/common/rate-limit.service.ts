/**
 * In-memory per-IP rate limiter, ported 1:1 from the legacy auth route's
 * `rateLimiter`. Each named bucket keeps its own attempt map; `check` returns
 * false once a key exceeds `max` within `windowMs` (the caller answers 429).
 *
 * The legacy route ran a setInterval to garbage-collect expired records. There
 * is no timer here — a dangling one leaks in tests — but the housekeeping is
 * back as a lazy sweep driven by the `now` the caller already passes: keys are
 * per-IP and proxy-header derived, so without it a bucket grows for every
 * address that ever knocked and never shrinks again. An expired record is
 * treated as fresh by the window check below, so dropping it changes nothing
 * about who gets a 429.
