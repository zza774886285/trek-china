/**
 * Adding an existing user to a trip as a member, plus the leaf membership
 * READS. Its own domain rather than a method on auth or trip-invite: both of
 * those call it, as does OIDC and the plugin RPC host, and folding it into
 * either would put AuthModule and TripInviteModule in a cycle.
 *
 * The reads exist for the same reason: BudgetMcp and CostsRpc need "who is on
 * this trip" / "which trips can this user see", but every service that owns
 * the hydrated answer (TripsService, TripMembersService, TripReadModelService)
 * lives in a module that imports the budget domain, so injecting one there
 * closes a real cycle. This module imports nothing, so it is the one place
 * those id-level reads can live — the fold that deleted trips.bridge.
