/**
 * The one place idempotency keys are minted.
 *
 * Every producer — the offline queue's mutation id, the axios interceptor's
 * per-request key and the upload queue's per-file key — ends up in the same
 * `X-Idempotency-Key` header, which the
 * server caches on (key, user_id, method, path). Two writes that share a key
 * therefore collapse into one: the second gets the first one's cached response
 * instead of being applied, and the user loses an edit with no error anywhere.
 *
 * `crypto.randomUUID` needs a secure context, and TREK's own quickstart is plain
 * http://localhost:3000 with LAN installs on http://192.168.x.x — so on the
 * deployments the README documents, randomUUID is undefined and the fallback is
 * what actually runs. It has to be a real one. `getRandomValues` has no
 * secure-context requirement and covers that gap; the Math.random rung below it
 * exists only for a runtime with no Web Crypto at all.
 *
 * Lives in its own module rather than next to either caller because
 * sync/mutationQueue imports api/client, so the dependency can only go one way.
