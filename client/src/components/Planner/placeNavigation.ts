 * Apple platforms open the installed app. Everywhere else the link still works,
 * because Apple Maps has had a web version since 2024, so a Windows or Linux
 * desktop gets a perfectly usable map rather than a dead end.
 *
 * Android is the one place it stays hidden: the web version works there too,
 * but nobody navigating from an Android phone reaches for Apple Maps, and the
 * row of choices is short for a reason.
 *
 * iPadOS 13 and later report themselves as "Macintosh", which is why the Mac
 * branch is not narrowed by touch: a real Mac has the app, an iPad has the app,
 * so both sides of that ambiguity are correct.

/**
 * The map apps a place can be opened in, in the order they are offered.
 *
 * None of them gets bare coordinates. Waze and Apple Maps both take a query
 * alongside the position (`q` in each case, documented by both), and the pair
 * is what makes the destination legible: the coordinates anchor which place is
 * meant, the name is what the driver sees on the screen instead of a number.
 * Without the position a name alone would be a gamble — there are a lot of
 * places called "Bahnhof" — so a place TREK has no coordinates for reaches
 * neither app.
 *
 * Google is the exception and keeps the link it always had, because it can do
 * better than a name: `getGoogleMapsUrlForPlace` walks ftid, then place id,
 * then the details URL, which lands on the right entry inside a mall rather
 * than on the roof.
 *
 * Waze arms navigation, since driving is the only thing it does. The other
 * three open the place, which is what Google has always done here, and starting
 * navigation from there is one tap.
