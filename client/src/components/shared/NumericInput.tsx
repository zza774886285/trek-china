/**
 * A numeric text input that replaces its contents when you type into it.
 *
 * Two things every numeric field in the app needs, and most were getting wrong (#1513):
 *
 *  1. **Select-on-focus.** Tapping a pre-populated field puts the caret at the end, so
 *     the first digit you type is *appended*: a quantity of 1 becomes 16 instead of 6.
 *     Selecting the value on focus makes the first keystroke replace it.
 *
 *     We select twice: synchronously (works everywhere) and again on the next frame,
 *     because WebKit undoes a synchronous select() with its own post-focus caret
 *     placement — without the deferred pass, iOS silently keeps appending.
 *
 *     The deferred pass is guarded. If a keystroke lands inside that one-frame window,
 *     re-selecting would swallow what was just typed: type "4" then "8", the frame
 *     fires and selects "48", and the next character *replaces* both — "48.853" comes
 *     out as ".853". So the first input cancels the pending select and we leave the
 *     caret alone.
 *
 *  2. **type="text" + inputMode**, not type="number". They render the same keypad, but
 *     type="number" also silently mutates the value on scroll-wheel over the field and
 *     ships spinner arrows. (setSelectionRange() also throws InvalidStateError on a
 *     number input — select() happens to be allowed, but the whole class is a trap.)
 *
 * Styling and commit semantics stay with the caller: some fields save on every keystroke,
 * others on blur. This owns only the part that was uniformly broken.
