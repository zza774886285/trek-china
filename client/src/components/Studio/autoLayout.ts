/**
 * The auto mode: turn a journey into a book.
 *
 * The one rule that shapes everything else is that this produces an **ordinary
 * document**. There is no "auto layout" state that locks, no template engine
 * that re-runs behind the user's back — it lays the pages out once, and from
 * that moment every element is as editable as one dragged in by hand. That is
 * what makes an auto mode feel generous rather than restrictive.
 *
 * The colours in here are print ink, not app chrome, and deliberately do not
 * follow the user's theme: a book is printed once and read on paper, where an
 * accent colour chosen for a dark UI means nothing — and the renderer has no
 * theme to ask. Hence the theme-lint exemptions below.
 *
 * Templates are chosen by what the material actually is: how many photos the
 * entry has, whether they are portrait or landscape, how much story there is to
 * set. A page of three landscape photos wants a different grid than a page of
 * one portrait, and picking by shape is the difference between a book that looks
 * arranged and one that looks poured in.

 * The thing the first version of this file was missing.
 *
 * A printed travel book is not photographs on paper with captions: it is
 * built out of *areas* — a page laid solid in ink with pale type on it, a band
 * down the outer edge, a picture that overruns the panel it sits against, a
 * box ruled around a block of text. Those areas are what carry the design, and
 * every one of them is a rectangle with a fill, drawn before the things that
 * sit on top of it.
 *
 * Which is all layering is: the document paints in array order, so a panel
 * pushed first is a panel everything else lands on. Nothing here needs a
 * feature the editor does not already have — it needed using.
